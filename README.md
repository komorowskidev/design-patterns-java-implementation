java implementation of some design patterns
testing with Spock Framework

## v1.11

adding Proxy
* Allows us to create an intermediary that acts as an interface to another resource. We should use this pattern:
 1. when we want a simplified version of a complex or heavy object (Virtual Proxy) 
 2. when the original object is present in different address space, and we want to represent it locally (Remote Proxy) 
 3. when we want to add a layer of security to the original underlying object to provide controlled access based on access rights of the client (Protection Proxy)

## v1.10

adding Facade
* Encapsulates a complex subsystem behind a simple interface.

## v1.9

adding Adapter
* This pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.

## v1.8

adding Command
* This pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting us parameterize other objects with different requests.

## v1.7

adding Decorator
* This pattern lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

## v1.6

adding Observer
* Observable maintains a list of its dependents objects, called observers, and notifies them of any state changes.

## v1.5

adding Strategy
* Strategy Pattern defines a set of encapsulated algorithms that can be swapped to carry out a specific behaviour.

## v1.4

adding Abstract Factory
* Abstract Factory provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## v1.3

adding Factory Method
* Factory Method pattern solving the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.

## v1.2

adding Fluent Builder
* Fluent Builder solving the problem of object constructor complexity
* Class Car has builder written manually
* Class CarWithLombok using Lombok to generate builder automatically
 
## v1.1 

adding Singleton implementations
* Singleton lets you ensure that a class has only one instance.
* SimpleSingleton implementation is creating an instance during starting application
* NoInstanceBeforeFirstUseSingleton implementation creates an instance after first call getInstance() method
* ThreadSafeSingleton implementation is synchronizing method getInstance() for multithreading application
* BestSingleton implementation is synchronizing block of code only for first creating instance
